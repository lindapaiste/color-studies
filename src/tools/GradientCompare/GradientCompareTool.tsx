/**
 * observations:
 * lab ( followed by rgb ) has the smoothest transition, though intermediate colors can appear dingy
 * hsv and hsl have good results on hue shift scales because intermediates are just as bright
 * hcl can have problem with intermediate cyans being too bright, while hsv appears to tone it down a bit more
 * hcl has much more consistent tone tha hsv on purple to orange and green to red
 *
 * difference is most obvious from royal blue to yellow
 * rgb goes though lighter blues
 * lab through lilacs
 * hcl through bright purple, pink, orange
 * hsv through cyan and green
